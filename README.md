# Ants and Bees

- This repository is a beginner's guide to Transfer Learning using Pytorch.
- It is a concise implementation of how to generalise on a very small dataset (<250 training images) using something called Transfer Learning.
- I have used a pretrained ResNet model with both finetuning the entire net as well as just adjusting the weights of the final layer to quickly generalise on this dataset and get accuracy of more than 95%.
